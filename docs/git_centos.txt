##install docker 
#Installing Docker - CentOS-7
#Docker is included by default in the CentOS-Extras repository. To install run the following command:

$ sudo yum install docker

#Starting the Docker daemon
#Once Docker is installed, you will need to start the docker daemon.

$ sudo service docker start
#If we want Docker to start at boot, we should also:

$ sudo chkconfig docker on
#Now let's verify that Docker is working. First we'll need to get the latest centos image.

$ sudo docker pull centos
#Next we'll make sure that we can see the image by running:

$ sudo docker images centos
#This should generate some output similar to:

$ sudo docker images centos
REPOSITORY      TAG             IMAGE ID          CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
centos          latest          0b443ba03958      2 hours ago         297.6 MB
#Run a simple bash shell to test the image:

$ sudo docker run -i -t centos /bin/bash
#If everything is working properly, you'll get a simple bash prompt. Type exit to continue.
